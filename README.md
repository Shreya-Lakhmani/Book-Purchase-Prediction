This project demonstrates how simple product attributes — price and
rating — can drive purchase decisions in an e-commerce setting. By
combining web scraping, simulated behavior modeling, and machine learning,
I built a system that predicts purchase likelihood with over 94% accuracy.
The model was deployed via a live Streamlit app, turning data insights into
an interactive experience. This reflects a ful data science pipeline — from
raw data to real-world usability


BeautifulSoup – Web scraping product data
Pandas / NumPy – Data handling
Scikit-learn – Machine learning
Streamlit – Interactive front-end
Joblib – Saving the trained model
