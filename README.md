This project demonstrates how fundamental product attributes — such as price and rating — influence purchase decisions in an e-commerce setting. By integrating web scraping, simulated user behavior modeling, and machine learning, I developed a predictive system capable of estimating purchase likelihood with over 94% accuracy. The model was deployed as a live Streamlit app, transforming data insights into an interactive user experience. This project illustrates a complete data science pipeline, from raw data acquisition to real-world deployment and usability.

BeautifulSoup – Web scraping product data
